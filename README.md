# weatherappintergration.html
This is a web page with an integrated weather API that displays real-time weather information based on user input or location.
To integrate a weather API into a web page, you can use JavaScript to make an API request and display the real-time weather information. In this web page, I used the OpenWeatherMap API. Note that you need to sign up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website to use their service.
This HTML file uses JavaScript to fetch and display the weather information.
Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. This web page includes an input field for the city name, a button to fetch weather information, and a display area for the retrieved data.
